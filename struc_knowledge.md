# Automatised Diary

Graphical frontend for launchd: "https://www.soma-zone.com/LaunchControl/"
  - Using LaunchControl I start "/Users/moritz/Diary/skript.sh" every
    half hour
  - This skript copies diary template to diary structure.
  **TODO**: Restructuring template, enable cloudsave, change the var
        for year in the skript.
